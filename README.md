# forensics-p10-database

We have decided to make a graph database using Neo4j. Reasons for this is that a graph
database is more scalable than e.g. realtional databases and querying information from the 
database is less expensive.

To run this project you first need to:
"docker compose build"
"docker compose up -d"

If you are using WSL2, remeber to start up your docker desktop application first.


To stop the project:
"docker compose down"
